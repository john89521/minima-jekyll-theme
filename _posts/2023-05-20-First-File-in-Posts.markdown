## Blog Post 1
This is my first blog post on my Jekyll site. 

This Jekyll stuff is goint to take some time to get used to. I will build the Skribisto help files in GitHub. Building them in Jekyll is probably not the best idea - it will probably take a lot of time. There is the learning of Jekyll then the learning of Skribisto. 

I am happy I was able to install Ruby and then install Jekyll. The first try did not go well, but the second try was very easy and successful. Now I need to work in some Ruby training just for the hell of it. 

I need to get an Azure account. I think I want to install a virtual environment and then install Pop OS in that environment and then install Skrbisto. That is one idea. The other idea is to do all the work on the laptop. That will be challenging; however, because I am working in GitHub and not in VS Code, the writing should be a tad bit easier. 

Jac has to figure out a way to install Skribisto much easier. People wont use it if it continues to be a pain in the ass to install. Especially writers. 

### Going to leave these directions below

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
