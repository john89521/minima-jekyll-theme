# Dealing with Pages: Day 3
Once again, pages is proving to be a challenge.  
With images, I believe you must upload from desktop to the md file. And I think it has to be jpeg.  
I will try a png:  
<img width="347" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-23 at 4 30 15 PM" src="https://github.com/john89521/john89521.github.io/assets/13544800/83828952-f0b7-4d54-a08d-71af55eb2951">  
So png also work ðŸ˜¸  

This stuff is great when it works!
